    "answer": "The grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft in early January 2024 was primarily due to safety concerns related to the aircraft's flight control system, specifically the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). The MCAS was designed to prevent the aircraft from stalling by automatically pitching the nose down when the aircraft's angle of attack exceeded a certain threshold. However, it was later discovered that the MCAS could be triggered by false inputs from the aircraft's angle of attack sensors, leading to unintended nose-down pitching and potentially causing the aircraft to stall.\n\nOn October 29, 2018, a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max 8 experienced a sudden and uncontrolled descent shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia, resulting in a crash that killed all 189 people on board. The investigation into the accident revealed that the MCAS had been activated multiple times during the flight, causing the aircraft to pitch down and lose altitude. The investigation also found that the pilots had been trained to respond to MCAS activations by pulling back on the control column, which would have exacerbated the nose-down pitching and contributed to the crash.\n\nOn March 10, 201",

    "formulation": "New study finds largest great ape, Gigantopithecus blacki at 10 feet tall (3 meters), from southern China, went extinct because of climate change between 215,000 and 295,000 years ago.",
    "answer": "Scientists have published several recent findings regarding the extinction of Gigantopithecus blacki, the largest great ape, in relation to climate change. One study published in the journal Nature in 2019 suggested that the extinction of Gigantopithecus blacki was likely due to a combination of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and competition with other primates. The study found that the climate in the region where Gigantopithecus blacki lived became drier and more arid over time, which may have led to a decline in the availability of food and water resources. Additionally, the study suggested that competition with other primates, such as Homo erectus, may have also contributed to the extinction of Gigantopithecus blacki. Another study published in the journal Science Advances in 2020 suggested that the extinction of Gigantopithecus blacki was likely due to a combination of factors, including climate change, habitat loss, and human activity. The study found that the climate in the region where Gigantopithecus blacki lived became drier and more arid over time, which may have led to a decline in the availability of food and water resources",
